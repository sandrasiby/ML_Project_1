The zip file contains the following files:

*1* run.py : This is the main file to be run. As it is, it will perform regularized logistic regression using Newton's method. 
The basic outline of the file is as follows:
	- Read the training and test data
	- Split both sets of data (test and training) by the jet numbers 0 - 3. Split all the jets further by valid or invalid DER_MASS_MMC. For each jet, remove the features that are either
		not calculated (-999) or deemed irrelevant (See [1]).
	- Loop through each data set (8 of them, 2 for each jet - 1 with valid DER_MASS_MMC and the other with invalid DER_MASS_MMC)
		- Standardize feature set after removing outliers above a threshold specified in list_sd_limit
		- Conduct a polynomial expansion of the features (degree 2)
		- Obtain the weights and final loss function by using the desired classification model (currently logistic regression with Newton's method and lambda = 1.
		- Standardize test feature set using the mean and standard deviation of the training data set.
		- Get the predictions for the test data set for the current jet and mass validity. 
		- Add the predictions to the overall prediction list
	- Print the predictions to file, with the ids and corresponding predictions

*2* proj1_helpers.py - 
	- Standardization and outlier removal
	- Read, write data
	- Obtain and verify predictions
	- Split data by jet numbers + removal of unnecessary features
	- Polynomial expansion to the specified degree
	- Split data into test and training for cross validation
	
*3* implementations.py : All the regression models required
	- Linear:
		- Normal equations
		- Ridge regression
		- Gradient Descent
		- Stochastic Gradient Descent
	- Logistic
		- Gradient Descent
		- Regularized Gradient Descent
		- Newton's 
		- Regularized Newton's
	- Other functions required to calculate gradients, the log function and the Hessian
